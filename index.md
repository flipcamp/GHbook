title: Engaging Students â€“ Essays in Music Pedagogy
---
_Engaging Students: Essays in Music Pedagogy_ presents short essays on the subject of student-centered learning, and serves as an open-access, web-based resource for those teaching college-level classes in music.

The motivation behind the assembly of this collection was drawn in part from our vision for a new format for scholarly communication based upon collaborative and swift peer review. We take our inspiration from hack-a-thons, in which creative solutions to a problem emerge from working intensely together in a collaborative environment for a limited time. Authors received feedback quickly, and the revision process consisted of efficient online interactions with the editorial group. The final result is not only open-access, but open-source. Each essay is licensed to encourage collaboration to continue post-publication, as the essays are distributed, remixed, and hacked in various ways. And these volumes can be ["forked"](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/Journal/files/GitHub_for_Academics.html) and used as the basis for new projects or updates to the current project.

*Engaging Students* has published the following volumes to date:

- [Volume 1 (2013)](http://flipcamp.org/engagingstudents/toc.html)  
- [Volume 2 (2014)](http://flipcamp.org/engagingstudents2/)

- [Volume 4 (2016), *Engaging Students through Jazz*](http://flipcamp.org/engagingstudents4/)  
- [Volume 5 (2017](http://flipcamp.org/engagingstudents5/)
 
We hope that these and future volumes will help you empower your students to be thoughtful, critical, skilled musicians. Please contact [flipcampmt@gmail.com](mailto:flipcampmt@gmail.com) with any questions or comments.
