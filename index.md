title: Engaging Students – Essays in Music Pedagogy
---
_Engaging Students: Essays in Music Pedagogy_ presents short essays on the subject of student-centered learning, and serves as an open-access, web-based resource for those teaching college-level classes in music.

The motivation behind the assembly of this collection was drawn in part from our vision for a new format for scholarly communication based upon collaborative and swift peer review. We take our inspiration from hack-a-thons, in which creative solutions to a problem emerge from working intensely together in a collaborative environment for a limited time. Authors received feedback quickly, and the revision process consisted of efficient online interactions with the editorial group. The final result is not only open-access, but open-source. Each essay is licensed to encourage collaboration to continue post-publication, as the essays are distributed, remixed, and hacked in various ways. And the entire volume can be ["forked"](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/Journal/files/GitHub_for_Academics.html) and used as the basis for new projects or updates to the current project.

This volume contains essays dealing with theory ([Shaffer and Hughes](shafferintro.html), [Jacobus](jacobus.html)), practice ([Burke](burke.html), [Colletti](colletti.html), [Johnson](johnson.html), [Roust](roust.html), [Schubert](schubert.html)), assessment ([Alegant and Sawhill](alegantSawhill.html), [Gawboy](gawboy.html), [Rifkin](rifkin.html)), and technology ([de Clercq](deClercq.html), [Duker](duker.html), [Gosden](gosden.html), [Ludwig](ludwig.html), [Peebles](peebles.html)) as they relate to music pedagogy. 

We hope that you enjoy reading this volume as much as we have enjoyed putting it together.
