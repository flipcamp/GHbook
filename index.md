title: Engaging Students â€“ Essays in Music Pedagogy
---
_Engaging Students: Essays in Music Pedagogy_ presents short essays on the subject of student-centered learning, and serves as a pedagogical resource for those teaching college-level classes in music.

The motivation behind the assembly of this collection was drawn in part from our vision for a new format for scholarly communication based upon collaborative and swift peer review. We take our inspiration from hack-a-thons, in which creative solutions to a problem emerge from working intensely together in a collaborative environment for a limited time. Authors received feedback quickly, and the revision process consisted of efficient online interactions with the editorial group. The final result is open-access and published under a Creative Commons license. Beginning with Volume 7, the journal is hosted and published by The Ohio State University Libraries.
